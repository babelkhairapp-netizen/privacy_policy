    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025-12-30</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>BabelKhair</strong> — an e-commerce app connecting users with hair & beauty products and services. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use our app in <span class="badge">Guest Mode</span> and <span class="badge">User Mode</span>. Please read it carefully.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to information collected through our mobile and web apps (the “Service”). It does not apply to information collected offline or through third-party services unless expressly stated.</p>

    <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Guest Mode</strong>: Browsing or shopping without signing into an account.</li>
      <li><strong>User Mode</strong>: Using the Service with a registered account (signed in).</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Data</strong>: Information that identifies or can reasonably identify an individual.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Information Collected in Guest Mode</h3>
    <p>When you browse in Guest Mode we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device and browser information (device type, OS, browser version).</li>
      <li>Non-identifying analytics (pages viewed, time on site, actions taken) to improve the experience.</li>
      <li>Temporary session identifiers and locally stored data (for cart persistence while the session is active).</li>
      <li>Location data if you permit it (approximate city-level location) to show nearby offers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Information Collected in User Mode</h3>
    <p>When you register and use an account, we collect additional Personal Data, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, email address, phone number.</li>
      <li>Shipping and billing addresses, payment method metadata (we rely on third-party payment processors; we do not store full card numbers).</li>
      <li>Order history, wishlist, reviews and ratings you submit.</li>
      <li>Profile preferences, saved searches, and personalization data.</li>
      <li>Customer support messages and other communications you send to us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and operate the Service, process orders, and manage accounts.</li>
      <li>To personalize content, product recommendations, and marketing communications (with opt-out options).</li>
      <li>To detect, prevent, and address fraud or other illegal activity.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage and improve our products and features.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies, web beacons, and local storage to enable essential features, remember preferences, and support analytics. You can control cookies through your browser settings; however, disabling cookies may affect functionality (for example, cart persistence in Guest Mode).</p>

    <h2>6. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers (payment processors, delivery partners, analytics providers) who process data on our behalf.</li>
      <li>Third parties when you choose to link accounts or share content externally.</li>
      <li>Law enforcement or regulators when required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Payment Security</h2>
    <p>We use reputable third-party payment processors to handle payments. We do not store full payment card numbers on our servers. For details on how payment data is handled, refer to the payment provider’s privacy and security documentation presented at checkout.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain Personal Data as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Guest Mode session data is kept temporarily to support the session and cart; you can clear local data through your device or browser settings.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete your Personal Data, and to object to or restrict processing. Registered users can access and manage much of their data through account settings. To exercise other rights, contact us using the details below.</p>

    <h2>10. Children</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not intended for children under 13 (or higher minimum age where required). We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children. If you believe we have, contact us and we will take steps to delete such data.</p>

    <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. We take steps to safeguard data consistent with applicable law, including contractual protections with service providers.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy; we will post the revised date at the top and, where appropriate, provide additional notice. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
